# Learning how to learn

This is a web development project - a rather previous revision - from [TripleTen a.k.a. Practicum](https://tripleten.co.il). Besides learning how to learn, it's more of a hands-off approach to learning how to build a website while still following its briefs.

## Techs used

- Semantic HTML5
- CSS animations
- The BEM methodology (block pages & flat files)
- Video embeds

## Plans for improvement

- More video learning materials and recommendations
- Registration forms
- Custom fonts
- Dark Mode theming
- and much more! Watch this space...

## ~~Installation~~

Simply extract the code in the main branch from the ZIP archive and run `index.html`.
